TODO: add use case scenarios

Features:
---------

* all log data is stored in folders and in markdown files that can be easily understood without any other software than a simple text editor.
* log data can be synchronized to an (on-premises) webserver to allow online access to the journal
* log messages can be entered by the following means:
	* web application
	* a simple desktop application that can be carried around on a USB stick
	* manually in the markdown source files
	* an app on a portable device

If I get to finish only half of these features, it's already totally amazing.
